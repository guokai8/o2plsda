Description: Provides functions to do 'O2PLS-DA' analysis for multiple omics data integration.
            The algorithm came from "O2-PLS, a two-block (X±Y) latent variable regression (LVR) method with an integral OSC filter" 
            which published by Johan Trygg and Svante Wold at 2003 <doi:10.1002/cem.775>. 
            'O2PLS' is a bidirectional multivariate regression method that aims to separate the covariance between
            two data sets (it was recently extended to multiple data sets) (Löfstedt and Trygg, 2011 <doi:10.1002/cem.1388>; Löfstedt et al., 2012 <doi:10.1016/j.aca.2013.06.026>) 
            from the systematic sources of variance being specific for each data set separately.
